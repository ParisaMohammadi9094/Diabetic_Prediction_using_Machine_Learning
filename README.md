# Predicting the Success of Startups

This project aims to predict the success of startups based on various financial and administrative features using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

In this project, we use a dataset containing information about various startups, including their spending on R&D, Administration, and Marketing, as well as their state location and profit. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can predict the profit of a startup based on these features.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains the following features:
- **R&D Spend**: Amount of money spent on research and development
- **Administration**: Amount of money spent on administration
- **Marketing Spend**: Amount of money spent on marketing
- **State**: The state in which the startup is located
- **Profit**: The profit earned by the startup (target variable)
