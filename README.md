# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project predicts the onset of diabetes based on diagnostic measures using machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this project is sourced from the `sklearn.datasets` module, specifically the diabetes dataset.

## Features
1. Utilizes logistic regression algorithm for classification.
2. Evaluates model performance using accuracy and classification report metrics.
3. Provides insights into the predictive capabilities of the model.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git`.
2. Navigate to the project directory `cd your_repository`.

## Usage
1. Open the `diabetes_prediction.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible platform.
2. Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to load the dataset, train the model, make predictions, and evaluate model performance.
3. Customize the notebook as needed to experiment with different algorithms, feature engineering techniques, or evaluation metrics.
