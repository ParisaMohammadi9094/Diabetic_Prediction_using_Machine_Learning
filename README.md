# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project predicts the onset of diabetes based on diagnostic measures using machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this project is sourced from the `sklearn.datasets` module, specifically the diabetes dataset.

## Features
1. Utilizes logistic regression algorithm for classification.
2. Evaluates model performance using accuracy and classification report metrics.
3. Provides insights into the predictive capabilities of the model.


## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
